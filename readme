Program to do sentiment analysis on data set of tweets. Tools used are Vader, TextBlob, and ChatGPT.

The chatgpt.py file is to be run once as OpenAI will only allow 60 queries/min to chatgpt. It creates a new csv file that Vader and TextBlob can also be run on to do an accuracy analysis and comparison.

Change the csv_name variable between "test.csv" and "chatgpt_version.csv" to see the results. Using "test.csv" will not use ChatGPT as it is a much larger data set.

If you want to run the ChatGPT code, generate an OpenAI key and change the "file_path" variable to the file path for your config.ini file.
